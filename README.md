**Code Louisville Data Science with Python Project**
This project is studying the impact of Volcanic Gases (SO<sub>2</sub> emission) on weather in Italy, using Etna volcano as an example. This is not a science project, but a small Data Science project that used a limited data - please don’t judge too hard.

All data about volcanoes comes from Smithsonian Institution Natural Museum of Natural History Global Volcanism Program
https://volcano.si.edu/

All historical climate data from the Climate Change Knowledge Portal by the World Bank Group
https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or newer
To check the installed Python version type `python3 –version` in the terminal. The latest Python version can be installed from here.
- Jupyter Notebook


## Installation
1. Clone or Download the project `git clone https://github.com/zmois/Volcanic-SO2-emission`
2. The easiest way to install Jupyter Notebooks is to download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python. The Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook included and no further installation steps are necessary. Download the "Anaconda" software https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section
3. Create a new virtual environment in Anaconda Navigator, step-by-step instructions can be found here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/
Next, install all the packages listed above manually
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - geopandas<br> 
**Note:** Geopandas package v0.8.1 would only work with Python 3.7

***Alternative for experienced Python users*** is to install Jupyter Notebook with pip3 `pip3 install jupyter`
- Create and activate the virtual environment, follow the instructions on how do it for different OS <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html> here</a><br>
Then install the following packages from the terminal using the pip commands 
 - pip3 install pandas
 - pip3 install numpy
 - pip3 install matplotlib
 - pip3 install seaborn
 - pip3 install geopandas 

## Running Jupyter Notebook
1. From the navigator's home click on the "Launch" button under Jupyter tab or Jupyter Lab. 
Or launch Jupyter Notebook in the terminal with `jupyter notebook` command. This will open Jupyter on a browser.
2. Go into working directory, open the ipynb file and run all cells.
