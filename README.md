**Code Louisville Data Science with Python Project**
This project is studying the impact of Volcanic Gases (SO<sub>2</sub> emission) on weather in Italy, using Etna volcano as an example. This is not a science project, but a small Data Science project that used a limited data - please don’t judge too hard.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or newer.
To check the installed Python version type `python3 –version` in the terminal. The latest Python version can be installed from here.
- Jupyter Notebook.
The easiest way to install Jupyter Notebooks is to download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python. The Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook included and no further installation steps are necessary. Download the "Anaconda" software https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section
Alternative for experienced Python users is to install Jupyter Notebook with **pip3**
`pip3 install jupyter`

## Installation
- Clone or Download the project `git clone https://github.com/zmois/Volcanic-SO2-emission`
- (Recommended) Create and activate the virtual environment, follow the instructions on how do it for different OS <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html> here</a>
- Install dependencies from `requirement.txt` file by typing `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 
Either install the following packages from the terminal using the pip commands 
- pip install pandas
- pip install numpy
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install seaborn
